(** Write an if expression that evaluates to 42 if 2 is greater than 1 and otherwise evaluates to 7 *)

let x = if 2 > 1 then 42 else 7

(** Using the increment function from above as a guide, define a function double that multiplies its input by 2 *)

let double x = 2 * x

(** Define a function that computes the cube of a floating-point number *)

let cube x = x *. x *. x

(** Define a function that computes the sign (1, 0, or -1) of an integer. Use a nested if expression *) 

let sign x = if x > 0 then 1 else if x = 0 then 0 else -1

(** Define a function that computes the area of a circle given its radius *)

let area_of_circle r = let pi = 3.14 in pi *. r. *r.
